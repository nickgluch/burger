# burger

The burger app is an app using Node, MySQL, Express, handlesbars, and an ORM made by me.

This app allows the user to add a burger, which move it to the 'Burgers to devour' area in which you can click 'devour' to eat the burger and add it to the Devoured area. The app also has persistent storage so the burgers and whether they are devoured or not, will still be there even on different sessions.
